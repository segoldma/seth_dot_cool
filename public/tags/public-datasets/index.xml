      <description>Washington, D.C. uses a system called SpotShotter, which involves acoustic sensors that can detect the presence and location of gunshots. The devices, which I believe are usually attached to utility poles, also transmit alerts to law enforcement, who can then respond to the incident. The city also makes the data publicly available on a quarterly basis via Open Data DC.
This is an incredibly sad topic, as the data here is mostly generated by real acts of violence throughout the city.</description>
