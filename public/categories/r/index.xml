      <description>I’m hellbent on winning a March Madness pool this year, and have been reading up on modern basketball analytics (i.e., KenPom, Dean Oliver, Sagarin, Lopez).
In the process, I’ve played around with scraping data from various websites, to analyze in R.
This is a quick exploration of player height according to 2017-18 NCAA D-I Men’s Basketball Rosters.
Average Height by TeamD-I teams tend to be around 6&#39;5&amp;quot; in average height – 8 inches taller than the average US adult male at 5&#39;9&amp;quot;.</description>

      <description>I registered the seth.cool domain a couple of years ago with no project in mind – only the misguided assumptions that (1) someone else would buy it, and (2) that I am cool. I’ve decided to finally use my first-mover’s advantage to share data-related projects as I work on them.
