      <description>I just returned from an event in Las Vegas, which intentionally coincided with the first weekend of the NCAA Men’s Basketball Tournament. In preparation, I attempted to analyze the 68 tournament NCAA Tournament teams, hoping to make a few profitable predictions. I went in with low expectations, thanks in part to statistics posts about how difficult it is to profit, even with better-than-the-bookmaker’s odds.

      <description>I’m hellbent on winning a March Madness pool this year, and have been reading up on modern basketball analytics (i.e., KenPom, Dean Oliver, Sagarin, Lopez).
In the process, I’ve played around with scraping data from various websites, to analyze in R.
This is a quick exploration of player height according to 2017-18 NCAA D-I Men’s Basketball Rosters.
Average Height by TeamD-I teams tend to be around 6&#39;5&amp;quot; in average height – 8 inches taller than the average US adult male at 5&#39;9&amp;quot;.</description>
