<p>As I’ve started to interact with more web data at work, I’ve felt the need to get more familiar with third-party APIs. Since the college football season kicks off next weekend, I’m writing this post as I experiment with the (seemingly) simple <a href="http://CollegeFootballData.com">CollegeFootballData.com</a> API for the first time.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://CollegeFootballData.com">CollegeFootballData.com</a> website has a nice interface for running reports on teams, games, drives, plays, recruiting, and more. However, some of these datasets, like plays, are very granular, which means that pulling out a full season’s worth of plays would require exporting one week of data at a time, and mashing them together in another tool. By using <a href="https://api.collegefootballdata.com/">the API</a>, I will probably still have to pull the data a week at a time, though it should be a more streamlined workflow than the more manual alternative. I guess that’s kind of the point of APIs.</p>
<div id="preparation" class="section level3">
<h3>Preparation</h3>
<p>I’ll be using a couple of R packages that help work with web data:<br />
- <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/httr">httr</a>: to interact with the API<br />
- <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/jsonlite/">jsonlite</a>: to parse the response data</p>
</div>
<div id="extracting-play-data" class="section level3">
<h3>Extracting Play Data</h3>
<p>First, I’ll send a request to the CFBData API to get play-level data from last season. Reviewing the documentation for the <a href="https://api.collegefootballdata.com/api/docs/?url=/api-docs.json#/plays/getPlays">/plays</a> endpoint, it seems like I can specify a number of parameters in my request (e.g., year, week, team, play type, etc.)</p>
<p>I’ve built the <code>path</code> object in the code chunk below using these parameters:<br />
- <code>seasonType</code>: regular season<br />
- <code>year</code>: 2018 season<br />
- <code>week</code>: 1</p>
<p>I’ll use the httr package to send a <code>GET</code> request using this absolute path, and call the response <code>r</code>. Next, I’ll check the http status of the response to make sure we can play nice with the server.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>path &lt;- &quot;https://api.collegefootballdata.com/plays?seasonType=regular&amp;year=2018&amp;week=1&quot;

r &lt;- httr::GET(url = path)

httr::http_status(r)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## $category
## [1] &quot;Success&quot;
## 
## $reason
## [1] &quot;OK&quot;
## 
## $message
## [1] &quot;Success: (200) OK&quot;</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="parsing-the-response" class="section level3">
<h3>Parsing the Response</h3>
<p>So far, so good. Next, I want to actually see the data I requested: play data from Week 1 of the 2018 CFB season.</p>
<p>I’ll call <code>httr::content()</code> on the response object, with results in text format. Then I’ll use <code>substring</code> to preview the first 500 characters of the response, which should be in <a href="https://www.json.org/">JSON format</a>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>r_content &lt;- httr::content(r, as = &quot;text&quot;)

substring(r_content, first = 1, last = 500)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;[{\&quot;id\&quot;:\&quot;401012246101884401\&quot;,\&quot;offense\&quot;:\&quot;Alabama\&quot;,\&quot;offense_conference\&quot;:\&quot;SEC\&quot;,\&quot;defense\&quot;:\&quot;Louisville\&quot;,\&quot;defense_conference\&quot;:\&quot;ACC\&quot;,\&quot;offense_score\&quot;:7,\&quot;defense_score\&quot;:0,\&quot;drive_id\&quot;:\&quot;4010122461\&quot;,\&quot;period\&quot;:1,\&quot;clock\&quot;:{\&quot;minutes\&quot;:11,\&quot;seconds\&quot;:55},\&quot;yard_line\&quot;:89,\&quot;down\&quot;:2,\&quot;distance\&quot;:2,\&quot;yards_gained\&quot;:11,\&quot;play_type\&quot;:\&quot;Passing Touchdown\&quot;,\&quot;play_text\&quot;:\&quot;Tua Tagovailoa pass complete to Jerry Jeudy for 11 yds for a TD, (Austin Jones KICK)\&quot;},{\&quot;id\&quot;:\&quot;401012246101864901\&quot;,\&quot;offense\&quot;:\&quot;Alabama\&quot;,\&quot;offense_conference\&quot;:\&quot;SEC\&quot;,\&quot;defens&quot;</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="converting-the-json-into-a-table" class="section level3">
<h3>Converting the JSON into a Table</h3>
<p>Seems like that worked. The last step will be to convert the <code>r_content</code> response object from its JSON format to a tabular format. To do so, I’ll use the <code>jsonlite::fromJSON()</code> function, and store the result as <code>r_tbl</code>. Finally, I’ll examine <code>r_tbl</code> using <code>dim()</code> and <code>summary()</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>r_tbl &lt;- jsonlite::fromJSON(r_content)

dim(r_tbl)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 16226    16</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>summary(r_tbl)</code></pre>

<h3>Wrapping Up</h3>
<p>That was pretty easy. Later on, I’ll create some R functions that take the API’s parameters as inputs, and produce the correctly-formatted URL as output. This will help further abstract this process, and allow me to get a dataframe full of glorious college football data with just one line of code. After that, I’ll try to iterate over this function with a series of parameters, in order to capture a season or multiple season’s worth of data in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://collegefootballdata.com">College Football Data</a> for their API, and to <a href="http://twitter.com/hadleywickham">Hadley Wickham</a>, and <a href="http://rstudio.com/">RStudio</a> for their power tools.</p>
