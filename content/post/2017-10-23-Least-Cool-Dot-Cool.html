<p>I registered the <a href="https://seth.cool">seth.cool</a> domain a couple of years ago with no project in mind – only the misguided assumptions that (1) someone else would buy it, and (2) that I am cool. I’ve decided to finally use my first-mover’s advantage to share data-related projects as I work on them.</p>
<p>A brief background on that: As my job has evolved to include more and more data analysis, I’ve found myself spending a lot of time waiting for Excel to <del>unfreeze</del> respond. A longtime friend of mine suggested that I learn R, and shared two textbooks (<a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596809164.do">R Cookbook</a> and <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920023135.do">R Graphics Cookbook</a>). These, Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund’s <a href="http://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html">R for Data Science</a>, along with several <a href="http://datacamp.com">DataCamp</a>, <a href="http://coursera.com">Coursera</a>, and <a href="http://edx.org">edX</a> courses have me well on my way.</p>
<p>I plan to improve upon the aesthetics of this site in the future, which is built by Yihui Xie’s new <a href="https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/blogdown/index.html">blogdown package</a>. In the meantime, I’ll be honing my skills on the most interesting (<em>to me</em>) datasets I can find, and sharing my practice here.</p>
<p>I can be contacted via <a href="mailto:sethgoldman1@gmail.com">email</a>. Suggestions, corrections, and feedback are appreciated.</p>
