<p>I registered the <a href="https://seth.cool">seth.cool</a> domain in 2016 with no project in mind – only the misguided assumptions that someone else would buy it, and that I’m cool. A couple years later, I decided to use my first-mover’s advantage to share data-related projects as I worked on them.</p>
<p>At the time, data analysis was a relatively new interest of mine. While working on the customer support and renewals teams at <a href="http://discoveryeducation.com">Discovery Education</a>, I noticed that when I wasn’t communicating with customers, I was spending the majority of my time working with pseudo-CRMs<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> in Excel. The data grew larger (in relative spreadsheet terms), and I complained to a friend about my laptop freezing every time I ran VLOOKUPs, or tried to filter on a column. He suggested that I learn to use R, and recommended a few books<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> for me to get started.</p>
<p>As I learned the basics of data manipulating in R with the help of several amazing resources<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>, I realized I wanted to shift my professional focus from customer-facing to data-facing. After six months of learning, I felt I had the competency to do junior-level<em>-ish</em> data work, but no good way to prove it. In retrospect, I was lucky to have a manager who valued my Excel jockeying, and a year later, advocated for me to leave her team and join one that allowed me to focus on data. Before that lucky break, I discovered Yihui Xie’s excellent <a href="https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/blogdown/index.html">blogdown R package</a>, and decided that my best option for proving my new-found data competencies would be to start a data analysis blog, completely powered by R.</p>
<p>At some point, I plan to write a dedicated post detailing my somewhat unconventional experiences becoming a professional data practitioner.</p>
