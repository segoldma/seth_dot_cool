      <description>Washington, D.C. uses a system called SpotShotter, which involves acoustic sensors that can detect the presence and location of gunshots. The devices, which I believe are usually attached to utility poles, also transmit alerts to law enforcement, who can then respond to the incident. The city also makes the data publicly available on a quarterly basis via Open Data DC.
This is an incredibly sad topic, as the data here is mostly generated by real acts of violence throughout the city.</description>

      <description>As I’ve started to interact with more web data at work, I’ve felt the need to get more familiar with third-party APIs. Since the college football season kicks off next weekend, I’m writing this post as I experiment with the (seemingly) simple CollegeFootballData.com API for the first time.
The CollegeFootballData.com website has a nice interface for running reports on teams, games, drives, plays, recruiting, and more. However, some of these datasets, like plays, are very granular, which means that pulling out a full season’s worth of plays would require exporting one week of data at a time, and mashing them together in another tool.</description>

      <description>During the Duke-Kentucky college basketball season opener, after one of twelve of Duke’s made three-point shots, Jay Bilas claimed that “the best time to shoot a three is following an offensive rebound.” I’ve heard other commentators say this before, and wondered if it’s actually true. This post walks through my investigation of that claim using play-by-play data from the 2017-18 men’s college basketball season.
Preparing the dataMy play-by-play dataset includes 2.</description>

      <description>I just returned from an event in Las Vegas, which intentionally coincided with the first weekend of the NCAA Men’s Basketball Tournament. In preparation, I attempted to analyze the 68 tournament NCAA Tournament teams, hoping to make a few profitable predictions. I went in with low expectations, thanks in part to statistics posts about how difficult it is to profit, even with better-than-the-bookmaker’s odds.
I ended up breaking even. Here are a few of the plots I created using data from two Ken’s: Pomeroy’s Kenpom.</description>

      <description>I’m hellbent on winning a March Madness pool this year, and have been reading up on modern basketball analytics (i.e., KenPom, Dean Oliver, Sagarin, Lopez).
In the process, I’ve played around with scraping data from various websites, to analyze in R.
This is a quick exploration of player height according to 2017-18 NCAA D-I Men’s Basketball Rosters.
Average Height by TeamD-I teams tend to be around 6&#39;5&amp;quot; in average height – 8 inches taller than the average US adult male at 5&#39;9&amp;quot;.</description>
