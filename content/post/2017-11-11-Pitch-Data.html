<p>I downloaded a fairly large amount of pitch data from the <a href="https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/statcast_search">MLB Statcast</a> database: every pitch thrown during the 2017 season, with ~75 variables about each.</p>
<div id="whats-the-plural-of-eephus" class="section level3">
<h3>What’s the plural of Eephus?</h3>
<p>For the uninitiated, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eephus_pitch">the Eephus</a> pitch is a very, very slow baseball pitch. I’d hoped that the plural of eephus would be eephucies (like matrices), but it turns out isn’t a real word at all. As far as I can tell from the <a href="https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=eephus&amp;year_start=1800&amp;year_end=2000&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=3&amp;share=&amp;direct_url=t1%3B%2Ceephus%3B%2Cc0#t1%3B%2Ceephus%3B%2Cc1">Google Ngram</a> viewer, it was first used in a baseball context around 1960. More on eephuses/eephucies later.</p>

<p>Eight of the top ten hardest throwing teams are in the National League, but since these rankings are likely buoyed by the relative velocity of fastballs thrown, I wanted to re-run the list by <code>fastballs</code> alone.</p>

<p>Since there was a bit of variance between the overall velocity and fastball velocity rankings, I wanted to get a sense of the MLB-wide velocity by <code>pitch type</code>. I didn’t remove the <code>Null</code> or <code>unknown</code> pitch types from the dataset, but I am curious as to how <code>AJ Ramos</code> chucked <code>11</code> nulls during the 2017 season.</p>

<p>Back to fastball velocity, I created a <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2288400">Cleveland plot</a> to visualize the aggregated averages of Four-Seam Fastball, Two-Seam Fastball, and Sinker, by team.</p>

<div id="pitch-velocity-by-team-by-common-pitch-type" class="section level3">
<h3>Pitch velocity by team (by common pitch type)</h3>
<p>Since the cleveland plot is a nice way to compare pitch velocity by team, I added a couple of additional common pitch types:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Four-Seam Fastball</code></li>
<li><code>Slider</code></li>
<li><code>Change-up</code></li>
<li><code>Curveball</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Before turning my attention back to eephuses, I wondered how fastball velocities varied <code>by inning</code>.</p>
</div>
<div id="fastball-velocity-by-inning" class="section level3">
<h3>Fastball velocity by Inning</h3>
<p><img src="/post/2017-11-11-Pitch-Data_files/figure-html/average_fb_velo_by_inning-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Looks like the starting pitcher’s velocity tends to fall off as they pitch deeper into a game. As relief pitchers enter the game, the average fastball velocities shoot up. Just a hunch: the velocities between the <code>5th</code> and <code>8th innings</code> are equally affected by each game’s innings pitched by starting pitchers and the timing of the <em>typically</em> hard-throwing relief pitchers entering the game. In other words, I’d predict that the average starting pitcher’s <code>IP</code> is around <code>5 innings</code>, which is when the average fastball velocity starts to increase.</p>

<p><code>RA Dickey</code> makes sense, being a knuckleballer, but I was surprised by James Shields. The <a href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/sports/slower-is-better-for-the-reinvented-james-shields/">Chicago Sun-Times</a> wrote about Shields’ <code>curveball</code> registering as an <code>eephus</code> early in the season, so these pitches may have been miscoded by <code>Statcast</code>.</p>
