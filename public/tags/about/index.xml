      <description>I registered the seth.cool domain in 2016 with no project in mind – only the misguided assumptions that someone else would buy it, and that I’m cool. A couple years later, I decided to use my first-mover’s advantage to share data-related projects as I worked on them.
At the time, data analysis was a relatively new interest of mine. While working on the customer support and renewals teams at Discovery Education, I noticed that when I wasn’t communicating with customers, I was spending the majority of my time working with pseudo-CRMs1 in Excel.</description>
