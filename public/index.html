So you were doing customer success for a few years, and then became a data manager… that’s pretty weird. How did that happen?
After summarizing how it happened, he said: You should be selling this story a lot harder.</div>

Early on, I made a point of writing as much of my code within the Tidyverse framework as possible, favoring the readability and supportive online community.
More recently, I’ve realized that I haven’t kept up with many of the enhancements that the Tidyverse and RStudio team have released.</div>

Spotify’s CEO recently noted on an earnings call that their secret sauce is online experimentation – running tests on its ~300M users, and using the learnings to improve its products. Two of the ways that Spotify evaluates the effectiveness of their experiments are (1) measuring increased engagement (streaming for longer periods of time), and (2) increased user retention (users returning to use Spotify’s products in the future).</div>

The devices, which I believe are usually attached to utility poles, also transmit alerts to law enforcement, who can then respond to the incident. The city also makes the data publicly available on a quarterly basis via Open Data DC.
This is an incredibly sad topic, as the data here is mostly generated by real acts of violence throughout the city.</div>

Since the college football season kicks off next weekend, I’m writing this post as I experiment with the (seemingly) simple CollegeFootballData.com API for the first time.
The CollegeFootballData.com website has a nice interface for running reports on teams, games, drives, plays, recruiting, and more. However, some of these datasets, like plays, are very granular, which means that pulling out a full season’s worth of plays would require exporting one week of data at a time, and mashing them together in another tool.</div>

This post walks through my investigation of that claim using play-by-play data from the 2017-18 men’s college basketball season.

I ended up breaking even. Here are a few of the plots I created using data from two Ken’s: Pomeroy’s Kenpom.</div>
