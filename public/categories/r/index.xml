      <title>Using an API to get College Football Data</title>

      <description>As I’ve started to interact with more web data at work, I’ve felt the need to get more familiar with third-party APIs. Since the college football season kicks off next weekend, I’m writing this post as I experiment with the (seemingly) simple CollegeFootballData.com API for the first time.
The CollegeFootballData.com website has a nice interface for running reports on teams, games, drives, plays, recruiting, and more. However, some of these datasets, like plays, are very granular, which means that pulling out a full season’s worth of plays would require exporting one week of data at a time, and mashing them together in another tool.</description>

      <description>During the Duke-Kentucky college basketball season opener, after one of twelve of Duke’s made three-point shots, Jay Bilas claimed that “the best time to shoot a three is following an offensive rebound.” I’ve heard other commentators say this before, and wondered if it’s actually true. This post walks through my investigation of that claim using play-by-play data from the 2017-18 men’s college basketball season.
Preparing the dataMy play-by-play dataset includes 2.</description>

      <description>This Fall, I’m playing in an NFL Pick’em contest with some friends from college. Each week, I predict the outcome of every NFL game according to Yahoo’s point-spread. For example, during Week 1 when the Patriots hosted the Texans, Yahoo assigned the Texans a seven-point handicap. My prediction came down to whether the Patriots would beat the Texans by more than seven points, or whether I thought the Texans would lose by no more than seven points (or win outright).</description>

      <title>Height and NCAA Hoops</title>

      <description>I’m hellbent on winning a March Madness pool this year, and have been reading up on modern basketball analytics (i.e., KenPom, Dean Oliver, Sagarin, Lopez).
In the process, I’ve played around with scraping data from various websites, to analyze in R.
This is a quick exploration of player height according to 2017-18 NCAA D-I Men’s Basketball Rosters.
Average Height by TeamD-I teams tend to be around 6&#39;5&amp;quot; in average height – 8 inches taller than the average US adult male at 5&#39;9&amp;quot;.</description>

      <description>I’ve lived in Washington for about four years, but have lived in the D.C. metropolitan area my whole life. When looking for datasets to practice ggplot2 plotting, I came across Open Data DC, a catalog of datasets maintained by various city government agencies.
I gravitated toward the Newly Updated or Added section, hoping to find a data that I haven’t read much about before. I decided on Service Request Data (i.</description>

      <description>I registered the seth.cool domain a couple of years ago with no project in mind – only the misguided assumptions that (1) someone else would buy it, and (2) that I am cool. I’ve decided to finally use my first-mover’s advantage to share data-related projects as I work on them.
Data analysis is a relatively new interest of mine. I started learning R after complaining to a friend about how much time I spend waiting for Excel to unfreeze at work.</description>
